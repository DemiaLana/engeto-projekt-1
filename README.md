Text Analyzer — Python Console Application

Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the Engeto Online Python Academy.
It is a console-based text analysis application that authenticates users, allows text selection, and performs statistical analysis on the chosen text.

The goal of the project is to practice core Python programming concepts through a complete, end-to-end script.

Key Features
	•	User authentication using a predefined dictionary of users
	•	Text selection from multiple predefined text samples
	•	Text preprocessing and word tokenization
	•	Statistical analysis of text content:
	•	total word count
	•	titlecase, uppercase, lowercase word counts
	•	numeric string detection and summation
	•	Frequency analysis of word lengths with a visual histogram output

⸻

Technologies Used
	•	Python
	•	Standard Python libraries

⸻

How It Works
	1.	The user logs in with a username and password.
	2.	After successful authentication, the user selects one of the available texts.
	3.	The program processes the selected text and computes various statistics.
	4.	Results are displayed in the console, including a histogram of word lengths.
